BJP5 Exercise 4.3: season

Write a method named season that takes two integers as parameters representing a month and day and that returns a String indicating the season for that month and day. Assume that months are specified as an integer between 1 and 12 (1 for January, 2 for February, and so on) and that the day of the month is a number between 1 and 31.
If the date falls between 12/16 and 3/15, you should return "Winter". If the date falls between 3/16 and 6/15, you should return "Spring". If the date falls between 6/16 and 9/15, you should return "Summer". And if the date falls between 9/16 and 12/15, you should return "Fall".
This is a method problem. Write a Java method as described. Do not write a complete program or class; just the method(s) above.

public static String season(int month, int day){
    if (((month == 3)&&(day > 15))||((month > 3)&&(month < 6))||((month == 6)&&(day < 16))) {
        return "Spring";
    } else if (((month == 6)&&(day > 15))||((month > 6)&&(month < 9))||((month == 9)&&(day < 16))) {
        return "Summer";
    } else if (((month == 9)&&(day > 15))||((month > 9)&&(month < 12))||((month == 12)&&(day < 16))) {
        return "Fall";
    } else {
        return "Winter";
    }
}
