BJP5 Exercise 4.10: printGPA

Write a method named printGPA that calculates a student's grade point average. The user will type a line of input containing the student's name, then a number of scores, followed by that many integer scores. Here are two example dialogues:

Enter a student record: Maria 5 72 91 84 89 78
Maria's grade is 82.8
Enter a student record: Jordan 4 86 71 62 90
Jordan's grade is 77.25
For example, Maria's grade is 82.8 because her average of (72 + 91 + 84 + 89 + 78) / 5 equals 82.8. Use a Scanner for user input.
This is a method problem. Write a Java method as described. Do not write a complete program or class; just the method(s) above.

public static void printGPA(){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter a student record: ");
    String name=sc.next();
    int n=sc.nextInt();
    int next, sum=0;
    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        next=sc.nextInt();
        sum += next;
    }
    double gpa = 1.0 * sum / n;
    System.out.println(name + "'s grade is " + gpa);
}
