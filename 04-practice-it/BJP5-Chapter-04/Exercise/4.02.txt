BJP5 Exercise 4.2: repl

Write a method named repl that accepts a String and a number of repetitions as parameters and returns the String concatenated that many times. For example, the call repl("hello", 3) returns "hellohellohello". If the number of repetitions is 0 or less, an empty string is returned.
This is a method problem. Write a Java method as described. Do not write a complete program or class; just the method(s) above.

public static String repl(String subStr, int n){
    String str = "";
    if (! subStr.equals("")) {
        int i;
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            str = str + subStr;
        }
    }
    return str;
}
