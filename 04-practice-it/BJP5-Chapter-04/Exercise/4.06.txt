BJP5 Exercise 4.6: printRange

Write a method called printRange that accepts two integers as arguments and prints the sequence of numbers between the two arguments, separated by spaces. Print an increasing sequence if the first argument is smaller than the second; otherwise, print a decreasing sequence. If the two numbers are the same, that number should be printed by itself. Here are some sample calls to printRange:

printRange(2, 7);
printRange(19, 11);
printRange(5, 5);
The output produced should be the following:

2 3 4 5 6 7 
19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 
5 
This is a method problem. Write a Java method as described. Do not write a complete program or class; just the method(s) above.

public static void printRange(int start, int end){
    if (start == end) {
        System.out.println(start + " ");
    } else if (start < end) {
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    } else if (start > end) {
        for (int i = start; i >= end; i--) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
