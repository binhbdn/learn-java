BJP5 Exercise 4.1: fractionSum

Write a method called fractionSum that accepts an integer parameter n and returns as a double the sum of the first n terms of the sequence:
1 + (1/2) + (1/3) + (1/4) + (1/5) + ...
You may assume that the parameter n is non-negative.
This is a method problem. Write a Java method as described. Do not write a complete program or class; just the method(s) above.

public static double fractionSum(int n){
    double sum = 0.0;
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += 1.0/i;
    }
    return sum;
}
