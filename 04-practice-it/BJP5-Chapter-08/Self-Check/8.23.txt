BJP5 Self-Check 8.23: publicVsPrivate

What is the difference between the public and private keywords?
Items declared public may be seen and used from any class, while items declared private may be seen and used only from within their own class.

What items should be declared private?
Objects' fields should be declared private to provide encapsulation, so that external code can't make unwanted direct modifications to the fields' values.
