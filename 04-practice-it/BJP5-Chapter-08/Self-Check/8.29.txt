BJP5 Self-Check 8.29: whatIsCohesion

What is cohesion? How can you tell whether a class is cohesive?
Cohesion is the concept of how well a class's contents go together. You can tell that a class is cohesive when each of its fields stores important state related to the object and each method interacts with that state in some way to produce useful behavior.
