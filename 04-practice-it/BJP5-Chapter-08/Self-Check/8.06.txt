BJP5 Self-Check 8.6: whatIsAField

A field's scope is throughout the class, while a parameter's scope is limited to the method.
A field is a variable that exists inside of an object, while a parameter is a variable inside a method whose value is passed in from outside.
Field syntax differs because they can be declared with the 'private' keyword.
