BJP5 Self-Check 1.24: Strange2

What is the output produced from the following program? You may wish to draw a structure diagram first. This is a slightly modified version of the previous problem, Strange.
public class Strange {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        first();
        third();
        second();
        third();
    }
    
    public static void first() {
        System.out.println("Inside first method.");
    }
    
    public static void second() {
        System.out.println("Inside second method.");
        first();
    }
    
    public static void third() {
        first();
        second();
        System.out.println("Inside third method.");
    }
}

output
