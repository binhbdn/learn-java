BJP5 Self-Check 2.15: firstSecond2
Rewrite the following code from the previous exercise to be shorter, by declaring the variables together on the same line, and by using the special assignment operators (e.g., +=, -=, *=, and /=) as appropriate.

​int first = 8;
int second = 19;
first = first + second;
second = first - second;
first = first - second;

shortened code

​int first = 8, second = 19;
first += second;
second = first - second;
first -= second;
