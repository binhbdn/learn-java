# [Introduction to Programming in Java](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/)

- [Chapter 1: Elements of Programming](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/10elements) introduces variables; assignment statements; built-in types of data; conditionals and loops; arrays; and input/output, including graphics and sound.
- [Chapter 2: Functions](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/20functions) highlights the idea of dividing a program into components that can be independently debugged, maintained, and reused.
- [Chapter 3: Object-Oriented Programming](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/30oop) emphasizes the concept of a data type and its implementation, using Java's class mechanism.
- [Chapter 4: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/40algorithms) discusses classical algorithms for sorting and searching, and fundamental data structures, including stacks, queues, and symbol tables.
